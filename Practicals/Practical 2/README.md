# Implementing a standard BST
This practical will guide me through implementing a standard BST in Java, focusing on recursion, insertion, traversal, and deletion. By the end, I will gain hands-on experience with these
operations, enhancing my understanding of both BSTs and their applications in computer science.

Only recursion is allowed for this assignment. No iterative solutions must be used, such as "do", "while", "for".
